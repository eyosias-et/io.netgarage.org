1.) The program runs the 'whoami' process but dosn't fully quallify the path

2.) Create a small executable that prints level5 password and compile it with the name whoami in a /tmp directory
   gcc ./whoami.c -o whoami

3.) Launch the level but set the first search location in the PATH environment variable to our temp directory
    PATH=./:$PATH /levels/level04

4.) That will use our whoami executable and print level5's password, since the spawned child process inherits the access rights of the caller by default


////////// OR

1.) Just create a whoami file with executable privliges and have it cat the password
